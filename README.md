  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>Hi! I'm a junior at the University of Notre Dame studying Computer Science with a minor in Engineering Corporate Practice. Originally from the Bay Area, CA, I love trips to the coast, colorful sunsets, photography, beach volleyball, and golf. I'm passionate about using technology and innovation as a force for good.</p>

  <p>I spent this past summer in Lyon, France researching AI transformer neural network acceleration through emerging in-memory computing technologies. I am continuing this research by co-authoring a paper that introduces the 1FeFET-1C model and explores how its multi-modality storage solutions improve energy efficiency and reduce latency of AI workloads. This fall, I am expanding my AI research to Recommendation Systems as well. My technical knowledge is complemented by my business minor and leadership experience with human-centered design thinking and innovation. I am a team collaborator who can drive decisions and solve problems with creativity and empathy.</p>
